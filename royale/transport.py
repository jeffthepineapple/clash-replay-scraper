"""How this scraper talks to RoyaleAPI.

Cloudflare fingerprints the TLS/HTTP2 handshake, so a cf_clearance cookie is
only honoured for the client that earned it. Handing the browser's clearance to
an outside HTTP client no longer works at all -- curl carrying a fresh
clearance is answered 403 on every path, public ones included. So every request
is issued as a fetch() from inside the page that holds the pass.

Pages   headful Chromium, and the fetch engine. Two contexts share one browser:
        `anon` for public pages, `auth` carrying the RoyaleAPI session cookie
        for the login-gated /data/replay. Public crawling stays anonymous, and
        the account is only ever exposed on the requests that require it.

Client  requests, retries and the shared rate Limiter. Sync Playwright is
        pinned to the thread that created it, so fetches cannot be spread over
        a thread pool; concurrency comes from Promise.all inside the page
        instead. That is why the primitive here is get_many, not get.
